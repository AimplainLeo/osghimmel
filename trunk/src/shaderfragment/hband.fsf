// The general composition of two colors is specified in these two macros:
// The first (default) uses the alpha value of src, the other allows over-
// writing it. The Blending function is specified via COMPOSE parameter.

// e.g. IMP_COMPOSE(multiply, b * s) creates the blend_multiply function
// that uses back * src as intermediate composition.

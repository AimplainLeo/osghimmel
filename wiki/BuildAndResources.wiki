I (dm) am developing osghimmel with CMake 2.8.5, OSG 2.8.5 and Qt 4.8.0. Usually i prefer to build x64 binaries and since all mentioned libs and tools above are opensource, i build them my self. To bypass building third party libs yourself, this wikipage provides build instructions and lists available binary resources for each of them.

= Requirements and Binaries =

QtPropertyBrowser
 * Sources ([http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-solutions/qt-solutions/trees/master/qtpropertybrowser located here]) are included in the trunk. No additional building is required.

CMake
 * Version *2.8 or higher* is recommended
 * Latest downloads can be found here [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html].

OpenSceneGraph
 * osghimmel requires [http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg OpenSceneGraph] tagged *2.8.5 or higher*. 
 * Up-to-date sets of working binaries can be found at [http://openscenegraph.alphapixel.com/osg/downloads/free-openscenegraph-binary-downloads Alpha Pixel].

Qt
 * The skybox (osghimmel's sandbox) requires Qt4 tagged *4.7 or higher*.
 * [http://code.google.com/p/qt-msvc-installer/downloads/list qt-msvc-installer] provides several Microsoft Visual Studio builds.

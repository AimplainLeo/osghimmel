== Himmel Time ==

_TimeF_ manages an osg::Timer and features an interface for floating time in the closed interval `[`0;1`]` representing a full day and standard c time (_time_t_) simultaneously. The time updates have to be requested explicitly, thus simplifying usage between multiple recipients.

Each instance of _AbstractHimmel_ requires a _TimeF_ instance. 

{{{
TimeF *timef = new TimeF(0.f, 60.f); // one minute for cycling a day
himmel->assignTime(timef);

...

timef->update();

}}}

The time starts cycling automatically, but can also be paused, stopped, or set to a specific value. Seconds per Cycle specify the duration of one day in seconds and is used while running. It can be changed at any time without tampering the time.
